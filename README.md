Life Insurance Good, Bad and The Ugly
## Overview and Origin
The life insurance industry has long struggled to rise in growth % at rates compared to other fintech industries even though year over year their sales do continually go up. I believe the reason for the poor performance in the Life Insurance industry in comparison to other investment domains includes, unwilling to change, grow, and learn, but also there is another major disease in the financial world. Everyone would like to talk about how everything is becoming decentralized with information and schooling. Unfortuantely the education found in school can only make you qualified to work for someone else. The real success comes from getting the education and then coursing uncharted waters with what you now know and through the journey figuring out what you need to know. 
* Name of company
Suncor Financial is the name of the company I will be discussing in this report with little to no sources as the experience is my own, but very applicable to this study.

The company was first incorporated in 2014 with no revenue until after the start of 2017.
* Who are the founders of the company?
The orginial founders included one of my older brothers and myself.

I spent six months manipulating client retirement illustrations until I mastered and perfected the Indexed Universal Life, which maximized the insurance company profits, the sales agents annual commissions, and the clients long term average annual return on investment percent.

My older brother funded the company that is now 100% his with millions from his 10 year old granite businesss he left for the insurance opportuinity I discovered.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
For 100 years life insurance never evolved past infinite banking in a whole life policy until the year 2,000 when the Indexed Universal Life was invented. With my work and Suncor's efforts they now are the #1 life insurance sales brokerage in the country and revolutionizing the whole industry.
* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Life insurance is uniquley good for all people. When the ROI can outperform 401(k)s and Roth IRAs then the benefit of having life insurance becomes truly a blessing rather than an unneccesary charge. With reduced commissions, increased transpearancey and increased output for the client it makes all people poor or rich alike potential buyers into the Suncor MPI plan.
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Rather than focusing their main efforts on streamlining and effecieny of sales, they focus purely on the effeciency of money from the time it hits the account till 100 years later when you plan to leave a legacy for the beneficiaries of your life insurance policy. By imporving the option to bond strategy inside the IUL the imporvements they have found will outperform all other life insurance carriers improvements because no one else is focusing on the return of money.
